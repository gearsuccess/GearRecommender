Overview:
GearRecommender is a python library for recommendation system. It aims to provide a convenient tool for researchers.

Algorithms:
There are 5 classes in this library:
1.collaborative filtering methods
2.content based methods
3.context aware methods
4.hybrid methods
5.other methods

For collaborative filtering methods, we implement item-based cf, user-based cf, BPR,etc. For other categories, they are still under development.

How to run
1. Download our library
2. Config the method
3. run App.py

Development
1. Registering your method in AlgFactory.py
2. Implementing your own method, note that fit()(model train) and score()(model evaluation) are necessary functions that you must implement

Features:
1. Automatic parameter tuning
2. Parallel running(different models and different parameters)
